           If the number is even then check if it is greater than 1000 or not.
           If the number is greater than 1000, then print "Even value is large", else print "Even value is just right".
           Example Output:
           Please enter a number
           Value is odd
           Example Output:

	      Write a program that will print the sum of all elements in 2D array.
	      Expected Output:
	      -9
	      
	      82.
	      For you to do:
	      Write a program that calculates the sum of elements from each row in a 2D array and adds them into array of integers
	      For example, if we run rowSums for the following 2D array:
	      {
	      {1,1,2}, //sum = 4
	      {1,1,2}, //sum = 4
	      {3,1,2}, //sum = 6
	      {3,1,2}, //sum = 6
	      {3,5,3}, //sum = 11
          {3,5,3}, //sum = 11
	      {0,1,2}  //sum = 3
	      {0,1,2}  //sum = 3
	      }
	      Then we should get the following array back:
	      4
          6
          11
          3
          
          83.
          For you to do:
          Write a program that prints the total number of elements that are negative AND odd
          Output:
          3
          
          84.
          For you to do:
          Write a program that sums all numbers that are on even index and on even row.
          Expected Output:
          -4
          
          85.
          Create a class 'Main' (please do not make it public as Repl will give you an error)
          Inside class declare a String variable 'name' and integer variable 'roll_no'.
          Create an object of the class and assign the value of 2 to roll_no and value of "John" to name
          Your program should print the following:
          Name is John and roll number is 2
          
          86.
          For you to do:
          Create a class named 'Main' with specific attributes.
          Create two objects of that class in which you will be assigning the following values and then print them.
          carColor='Black'
          carYear=2019
          carMake='BMW'
          carColor='White'
          carYear=2018
          carMake='Toyota'
          Expected Output:
          Car color is Black and car year is 2019 and car model is BMW
          Car color is White and car year is 2018 and car model is Toyota
          
          87.
          Create a Class Main
          In this class, you should specify the following attributes: breed, name, color, and following behaviors: bark(), run(), play().
          Create 3 different objects of it: Husky, Bulldog, Labrador with specific attributes and behaviors.
          The output of the program should be as following:
          Husky can bark
          Husky can run
          Husky can play
          Bulldog can bark
          Bulldog can run
          Bulldog can play
          Labrador can bark
          Labrador can run
          Labrador can play
          
          88.
